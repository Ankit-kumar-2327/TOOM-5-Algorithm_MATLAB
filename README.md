# TOOM-5-Algorithm_MATLAB
This Algorithm belongs to VLSI Architecture for Large Integer Multiplication , Implemented in Matlab using Symbolic Math Tool Box.I Implemented the Algorithm using the evaluation Points {0,1,-1,2,-2,3,-3,4,inf} however in conventional method we generally takes evaluation points as {0,1,-1,2,-2,4,-4,8,inf}.

I also implemented this Algorithm using the MATLAB Command  intlinprog() (Mixed Integer Linear Programming).
<br>
Basically intlinprog() takes the Objective function and Values at each evaluation points for TOOM-5 and gives the final Multiplication value.
