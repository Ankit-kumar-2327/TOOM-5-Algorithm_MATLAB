# TOOM-5-Algorithm_MATLAB
This Algorithm belongs to VLSI Architecture for Large Integer Multiplication , Implemented in Matlab using Symbolic Math Tool Box.
I also implemented this Algorithm using the MATLAB Command  intlinprog() (Mixed Integer Linear Programming).
Basically intlinprog() takes the Objective function and Values at each evaluation points for TOOM-5 and gives the final Multiplication value.
